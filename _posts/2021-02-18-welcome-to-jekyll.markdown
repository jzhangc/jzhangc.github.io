This is my (temporary) website documenting my dry lab research. It will include AI, bioinformatics and other computatinal biology related projects.

I hope to have articles introducing these projects in the future. 

About myself:
Jing Zhang, PhD
- Experienced molecular biologist and data scientist. Holds a PhD in biology. Over 10 years research experiences have led to more than 30 peer-reviewed journal articles. 
- Main research interest: model biological systems against traumatic environments and the associated physical and psychological medical conditions with AI (artificial intelligence) and “omics” level data. 
- Research philosophy: combine biological domain knowledge and AI techniques to answer research questions and explore translational research potentials.
- Developed bioinformatics solutions for microarray, next generation sequencing (genome, transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, etc), LC-MS proteome, neuroimaging functional connectomes 
- A team player, contributed to a wide range of projects through an extensive collaborative research network. 
- An effective communicator, mentored team members and created partnerships, developing outcomes aiding project success and organizational growth. Shared research with award-winning presentations at more than 40 regional, national and international conferences.
- Working with the Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) since 2013, successfully conducted research critical to Canadian Forces members and veterans’ well-being, including discovering biomarkers and building diagnostic platforms for post-traumatic stress disorder, mild traumatic brain injury, high intensity interval training related operational stress, cold exposure and decompression sickness.
